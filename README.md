Module Two: Variables & Arithmetics
- Learn to store variables, perform arithmetic, follow Python naming rules, organize code into modules, and reuse existing code. Practice through labs, projects, and quizzes.
---
Module Three: Conditionals
- Learn execution flow based on logic or repeat tasks
---
Module Four: Iteration
- Learn execution flow using iterations (For and While Loops) and Statements (Break & Continue)
---
Module Five: Functions 
- Learn how to define and use functions, pass arguments, return values, and understand scope. Explore global variables, higher-order functions, and the difference between functions and methods. Gain hands-on practice with different argument types (`*args`, `**kwargs`), function reuse, and modular programming using Python modules and the `__name__ == "__main__"` construct.

Module Seven-A: Data Types: Data Types & Numbers Systems
- This module introduces Python data types (numeric, sequence, and container) and number systems, covering their characteristics, common operations, conversions, and practical use cases through lectures, live coding, labs, and projects.
